            Charlie Chaplin was a wonderful comedian. <br>Chaplin's film career in the United States began with a series of short silent films in 1914.<br> He founded 1919 in establishing the United Artists film company.<br> He developed into one of Hollywood's great stars, which, unlike many others, made the transition from silent film to soundtrack.<br> In 1932, he met Paulette Goddard and fell for her beauty and cynical humor.<br> The two secretly marched out at sea in 1936, the same year as the movie Modern Times - where they played against each other - had premiere.<br> They later played against each other even in the Dictator.<br> It was his third marriage and lasted until 1942.<br> Chaplin refused to become a US citizen.<br> He had major problems with the 1950s McCarthyism and was refused to leave the country for a long time.<br> When he eventually had to travel for a London visit at the premiere of Rampljus (1952), he was denied entry visa to the United States.<br> It is said that, during the voyage to England, he was notified that no entry permit was to wait.
